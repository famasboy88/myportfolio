 	<b>Basic Info:<br></b>
 	My name is <b>Kyle Aljun Yap, </b>a 3rd-Year IT student studying in the University of San Carlos.
 	<br>Currently this is the first portfolio website I have made and coincidentally this is also my first time building it on the framework of Ruby on Rails.
 	<br>I am in my 20 years of existence. I have 3 other siblings and I am the second eldest among them.
 	<br>My current status of relationship is single because of this quote:
 	<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
  <p class="mb-0">Aral muna bago landi!</p>
  <cite title="Source Title"> - Facebook</cite>
</blockquote>

 	<b>Hobby:<br></b>
 	My usual hobby, obviously, would always be something to do with computers or anything related to modern technology.
 	<br>Most of these would probably be computer games.
 	 But on the contrary I am also very picky with games. Below are the lists of games I have played, but believe me, they might be only few but I got addicted to some of them for more than 3 years.

 	<b>Likes and Dislikes:<br></b>
 	I have a couple of things I like and dislike. I like hanging out with my family instead of friends. I like to stay at home instead of going out. I like to eat when I'm loneyly and sad. I sometimes like to crack very corny jokes at serious moments. And these my friends is an exact example of a loser, please don;t follow. But moving on, most likely I would really appreciate it if someone would treat me for desserts, or better yet, if someone could buy me a drink from <i>ChaTime</i>. I would also like it if someone would buy me an Ice cream sundae from <i>Burger King</i>! I mean common' their sundae is great, isn't it? 
 	<br>Those are the things I would really like, but on the contrary I really disklike many things. Such things include Super duper, extra, very long, hard exams. I also hate doing assignments! ZZZzzzzzZZz... The stress me out. I also hate it when I waste my time on something I was forced to do. We all have gone through this. But the thing I really hate the most is spending $MONEY$ on useless things (Food is exceptional since food is life).
